    Base result model for all security detection operations.

    This generic model standardizes the output across different detection modules
    (Canaries, Scanners, etc.), making it easier to log and analyze threats uniformly.

    Attributes:
        threat_detected (bool): True if a threat or security violation was detected.
            False indicates the content is considered safe.
        timestamp (datetime): The UTC timestamp when the check was performed.
            Defaults to the current time.
        component (str): The name of the module that performed the check
            (e.g. 'Canary', 'YaraScanner').
        metadata (dict[str, Any]): A dictionary for arbitrary contextual data.
            Used for telemetry (e.g. latency, model versions, specific rule IDs).
