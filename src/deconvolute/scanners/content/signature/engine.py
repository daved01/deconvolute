    Scans for known threats, adversarial patterns, and PII using signatures.

    This scanner performs high-performance pattern matching against text content.
    It is designed to be the primary defense layer for scanning document ingestion
    pipelines (RAG) or validating raw user inputs.

    By default, it uses the SDK's bundled security baselines in 'rules/', which
    covers common jailbreaks and injection attempts. Users can override this by
    providing a path to their own custom YARA rules file.

    Attributes:
        local_rules_path (Path): The file path to the compiled or source YARA rules.
        _rules (yara.Rules): The compiled YARA rules object (C-extension).
        _executor (ThreadPoolExecutor): Thread pool for offloading blocking match
            operations.
