    Wraps an MCP ClientSession with the Deconvolute Firewall.

    The returned proxy looks and behaves exactly like a ``ClientSession``. Your
    IDE autocompletion, type hints, and existing code all keep working. Under
    the hood the proxy intercepts every MCP call and enforces the security
    policy before forwarding it to the real session:

    - **Tool Discovery** (``list_tools``): Hides tools the policy disallows.
    - **Tool Execution** (``call_tool``): Raises ``SecurityResultError`` if the
      tool is unauthorized or the arguments violate a policy constraint.

    Args:
        client: The connected ``mcp.ClientSession`` instance.
        policy_path: Path to the security policy YAML file.
        integrity: The integrity check mode.
            - "snapshot" (Default): Verifies tools against the definition seen at
              startup. Fast, but vulnerable if the server changes tool definitions
              at runtime.
            - "strict": Forces a re-verification of the tool definition before every
              execution. Prevents "Rug Pull" attacks but adds a network round-trip.

    Returns:
        T: A proxy of the same type as *client* that enforces security.

    Raises:
        ConfigurationError: If the policy file is missing or invalid.
        DeconvoluteError: If the ``mcp`` library is not installed.
        SecurityResultError: At runtime, when a call violates the policy.

    Examples:
        >>> from mcp import ClientSession
        >>> from deconvolute import mcp_guard
        >>>
        >>> async with ClientSession(...) as session:

    Wraps an LLM client with Deconvolute security defenses.

    The returned proxy is a drop-in replacement for your LLM client. The same
    interface and same type hints apply. Every API call is transparently intercepted:
    prompts are scanned **before** they reach the provider, and responses are
    scanned **after** they arrive. If a threat is detected at either stage a
    ``SecurityResultError`` is raised so you can handle it in your application.

    Args:
        client: The original LLM client instance. Currently supports
            ``openai.OpenAI`` and ``openai.AsyncOpenAI``.
        scanners: An optional list of configured scanner instances.
            If ``None`` (default), the Standard Defense Suite is loaded
            (Canary + Language). If a list is provided, only those scanners
            are used (Strict Mode).
        api_key: The Deconvolute API key. If provided, it is injected into
            any scanner that requires it but is missing configuration.

    Returns:
        T: A proxy of the same type as *client* that enforces security.

    Raises:
        DeconvoluteError: If the client type is unsupported or if the required
